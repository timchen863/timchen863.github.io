title: Uphill Robotic Hextech Explorer
description: Developed a 6-legged walking robot with the goal of exploring efficient locomotion strategies for sloped and uneven terrains. The project aimed to study biomechanically inspired gaits that enhance stability and energy efficiency in incline navigation. Led CAD design in Fusion 360, implementing adaptive leg geometries. Simulated motion in MATLAB to optimize gait patterns, achieving a 15% increase in stride efficiency on a 25Â° slope. Fabricated parts via 3D printing and laser cutting; assembled and field-tested the robot to evaluate real-world performance.
