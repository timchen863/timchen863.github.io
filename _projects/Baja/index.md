title: Baja Off-Road Illini SAE
description: As part of the suspension and chassis team, I helped design and test key components for our off-road vehicle. I used Ansys and Fusion 360 to run FEA and make sure parts could handle 3G dynamic loads with a safety factor of 1.5. I also created CAD models in PTC Creo for parts like tie rods, engine manifold, and shock absorber, and ran thermal analysis on brake rotors to improve durability. Working with the fab team, we cut down build time by 20% through better coordination and design for manufacturability.
skills: 
 - CAD
 - Soldering
 - Welding
 - PTC Creo
 - Autodesk Fusion 360
 - FEA
 - Ansys

- **Max Temp:** 546.6°C  
- **Min Temp:** 30.3°C  
- **Gradient shows:** 
  - Outer brake surface heats up rapidly  
  - Inner hub remains cooler, acting as a thermal sink  
  - Matches real rotor behavior under stress

<!--## Embedding youtube video
The second video has the autoplay on. copy and paste the 11-digit id found in the url link. <br>
*Example* : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v={**MhVw-MHGv4s**}&ab_channel=engineerguy
{% include youtube-video.html id="MhVw-MHGv4s" autoplay= "false"%}
{% include youtube-video.html id="XGC31lmdS6s" autoplay = "true" %}

you can also set up custom size by specifying the width (the aspect ratio has been set to 16/9). The default size is 560 pixels x 315 pixels.  

The width of the video below. Regardless of initial width, all the videos is responsive and will fit within the smaller screen.

## Starting a new line
leave two spaces "  " at the end or enter <br>

## Adding bold text
this is how you input **bold text**

## Adding italic text
Italicized text is the *cat's meow*.

## Adding ordered list
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
4. Fourth item

## Adding unordered list
- First item
- Second item
- Third item
- Fourth item

## Adding code block
```ruby
def hello_world
  puts "Hello, World!"
end
```

```python
def start()
  print("time to start!")
```

```javascript
let x = 1;
if (x === 1) {
  let x = 2;
  console.log(x);
}
console.log(x);

```

## Adding block quote
> A blockquote would look great if you need to highlight something


## Adding table 

| Header 1 | Header 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Row 1, Col 1 | Row 1, Col 2 |
| Row 2, Col 1 | Row 2, Col 2 |

make sure to leave aline betwen the table and the header-->
